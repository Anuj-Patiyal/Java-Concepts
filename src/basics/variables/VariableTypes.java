* 1. Local Variables:
        Declared within a method, constructor, or block.
        Accessible only within that scope.
        Created when the scope is entered and destroyed when the scope exits.

/*
 * 2. Instance Variables:
        Declared within a class but outside any method.
        Belong to each instance of the class, meaning each object has its own copy.
        Also known as non-static fields or member variables.

/*
 * 3. Class Variables (Static Variables):
        Declared within a class using the static keyword.
        Belong to the class itself, not to individual objects.
        Shared by all instances of the class.

/*
* Data Types of Variables:
        In addition to the types based on scope, variables in Java also have a data type that defines the kind of value they can store:
*Primitive Data Types:
    byte, short, int, long (for whole numbers)
    float, double (for floating-point numbers)
    boolean (for true or false values)
    char (for single characters)
        
* Reference Data Types:
    String (for text)
    Arrays (for collections of data)
    Objects of any class (user-defined or built-in)
